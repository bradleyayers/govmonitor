# The job's kill signal must be INT instead of the default TERM as celeryd only
# waits for currently executing tasks to complete if it receives the former.
kill signal INT

# As mentioned above, celeryd waits for currently executing tasks to complete
# before terminating. This might take too long for upstartâ€”by default it only
# waits 5 seconds before sending SIGKILL. Make it wait a bit longer.
kill timeout 300

# Change the `name` argument to something less general (e.g. project-celeryd)
# and (optionally) change the log file argument to the desired location.
